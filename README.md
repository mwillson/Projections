###PROJECTIONS - AN IDEA COMPANY

The purpose of this readme is to help anyone who uses the site (PROJECTIONS) to use
it appropriately for their needs.

Projections is an organization which intends to aid in the creative process of musicians,
as artists, through collaborative works with their fanbases. Fans, as "users" of the site
may submit works of their own creation (known as "projections") for the artist(s) of 
their choice to potentially own, distribute, and/or perform.


###Some Definitions

Artist - A person or group responsible for legally owning, distributing, and
         performing artwork - in the area of music (for the current purposes of the 
         organization).

Projection - This is, at the most basic level, an idea. A projection could be a mapping
	     of a particular artist's work onto a different domain (medium). It could
	     also be an original work intended for an artist's performance and ownership. 
             All projections are considered original works published under a
             Non-Derivative Creative Commons license, which may or may not require
             attribution to the "user" who owns it, depending on his/her preference.

User - Anyone who wants to use the site for the purpose of submitting projections.

Creator - The party responsible for overseeing the implementation and or physical 
          manifestation of a projection. This may be the user or an artist as specified
          in the projection submission.


###Users

Fill out the form under 'Submit A Projection' from the home page or your user profile
page. You may be contacted and follow-up information may be requested from you.

The projection submission form will be generated based on the initial category selec
tion. Currently, the categories are: Film, Painting/Static, Song.

A 'Film' Projection will be required to have a minimal description of the idea, a
script draft, and a set of 'storyboards'. These may be acquired by the user through
the process of collaboration with Creators on the site.

A 'Painting/Static' Projection can be any static visual medium, including but not li
mited to: painting, mosaic, relief, sculpture. The submission of a painting/static
projection minimally would include a sketch of the proposed work, and description of
the medium, and surface/canvas being used.

A 'Song' Projection minimally requires a title, (optional) set of lyrics, and written
musical notation for the instrumentation. The notation may be as simple as some sort 
of time notation over a set of chords, or as formal as is desired. 

By submitting the form, the user is giving express permission to create a certain type
of Creative Commons copyright license for their submitted work, and thus any artist
may decide to use that work within the terms of that license, including disbursing benefits 
to the creator, if applicable.

###Creators

Creators are users or artists who collaborate with users in the act of creating the 
physical constructions of Projections.

###Artists

Musicians may create a special artist account. They may, with this account, choose 
projections to pursue and associate themselves with. At this point, it is up to the
artist to, at their discretion, fullfill the terms of the Creative Commons license
with which the particular projection is associated.
